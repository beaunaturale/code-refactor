First Bootcamp Challenge

- Refactored Code in both CSS and HTML

- Objective to make the HTML more descriptive with logical flow. Clean up CSS by reducing the number of lines of code necessary. Adding 'ALT' tags to images. Give the existing website a title. Debug HTML to make all links work. Edited the nav bar to list elements inline, for cleaner look and better flow.

- Used lessons from the first week in class, to clone repo from GitHub, edit in VSCode and commit changes.
